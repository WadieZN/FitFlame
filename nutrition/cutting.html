    <div style="padding:15px; font-size: 18px;">
      <p>Cutting, in the context of fitness and bodybuilding, refers to a phase where individuals aim to reduce body fat
        while preserving muscle mass. It involves creating a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than the body
        needs for maintenance, combined with a combination of cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and a balanced
        diet. The goal of cutting is to achieve a leaner and more defined physique by reducing body fat levels,
        revealing muscle definition, and achieving a lower overall body weight.</p><br>
